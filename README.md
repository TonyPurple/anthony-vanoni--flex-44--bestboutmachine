# Best Bout Machine

This website is made for everyone who casts their annual vote for pro wrestling's match of the year, can't remember all the matches they watched, and just chooses something from Wrestle Kingdom. You know how it goes.

This project takes it's name from Kenny Omega, known as the Best Bout Machine during his time in Japan. He is arguably one of the greatest in-ring performers of all time and, without doubt, the greatest Canadian professional wrestler of his generation.

## Lessons Learned

This was my first foray into working with a database that I designed. Despite putting a lot of thought into my models, even as I write this I still consider various changes that I might make. While data excites me, I now realize how difficult it is to develop applications from an architecture and data perspective. I believe that I left opportunities to maximize functionality on the table by collecting data in a simplified format. On the other side of that coin, I remind myself that the purpose of this project was not specifically database design but, rather, server-side JavaScript. I did manage to make the MVP for the project's idea, and was able to push a bit beyond that. Ultimately, this should be considered a success but perhaps the greatest takeaway is that no project is ever truly finished!

## üöÄ About Me
I've been somewhere in the middle of creative and technical my whole life. Software development has proven to be the outlet for both that I was always looking for. This was my unit 2 project for the remote flex software engineering immersive through General Assembly, where I am graduated with skills and experience in full-stack development in April 2022.



## ‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact...

It was my childhood dream to become a professional wrestler. While life took me down other roads (not to mention having the athletic ability of a software developer), at the age of 31 I spent a summer literally learning the ropes at a professional wrestling school on Vancouver Island. At that point, I never intended to pursue it as any sort of career but I suppose I was hoping to prove something to my childhood self. My summer as Surrey Jack will be as close as I get to that childhood dream, but this project makes me feel positive about the potential of turning this adulthood dream into a reality. I am happy to have been able to pair my passion for wrestling with my passion for development.
